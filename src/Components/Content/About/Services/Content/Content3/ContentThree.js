      <h5>Software Engineer</h5>
      <p>
        I have a strong passion for problem-solving and development. Studying Computer Science has really provided me with an extensive background of data structures, 
        algorithms and time complexity. I also have experience with CE, CI, and CD.
        I have the ability troubleshoot and debug software issues from large codebases of software written in Java/Python as those are my preferred languages.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I can work closely with clients, plan & analyse their requirements, create clear documentation with technical specifications and develop easy-to-read 
        code with comments. 
        I have the capacity work closely with other individuals/teams, to research, create, test, deploy and maintain software programs.
