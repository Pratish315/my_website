          <p>
          Since a young boy I was fascinated with computers and how they work. Computers is what I do, and I do what I love, every single day! I am continuously driven
          to solve problems, whilst simultaneously expanding my knowledge. For me, it is a privilege to be given the opportunity
          to do this within my employer's environment.                          
          <br />
          <br />
          I am currently working as a Data Scientist at ShopriteX, with over 2 years of experience in Big Data, Data Science, Software Engineering, Data Engineering and Dev-Ops.
          <br />
          <br />        
          My passion is full-stack software development and I am enthusiastic about machine learning, artificial intelligence and autonomous operations.
          I am always curious to learn from others and develop strong relationships with co-workers. I am a flexible team player that prospers in a fast-paced environment. I thoroughly enjoy spending time with family and friends. Other hobbies of mine include going to the gym, indulging in gourmet foods, playing soccer/cricket, gaming, travelling and finallyâ€¦ coding!
